<!-- shift 1 enter to populate the backbone html -->
<!-- div don't do anything unless there is css with it -->
<!-- to have space btw the content and the border - increase 'padding'-->
<!-- margin is the spacing btw elements / give a little space between the elements -->
<!-- increasing the margin doesn't increase the size of the element -->

<!-- DISPLAY PROPERTY -->
<!-- display: block , means that the element will take the whole line, as in blocking any other elements -->
<!-- some common block elements : p, headers , div, lists and forms -->
<!-- span element is an inline display element also img and anchors (a) -->
<!-- inline display elements can't change their width -->
<!-- to have flexible width, have the display as inline-block -->
<!-- display none will simply remove the element , visibility will make the element disappear but the position of the element will remain -->

<!-- STATIC/RELATIVE POSITIONING-->
<!-- by default , all children elements sit on top of parent elements -->
<!-- z-index property will let u decide which element is on top -->
<!-- static position, means default html rules (normal html flow)-->
<!-- all elements are static by default -->
<!-- relative position, u can move the element by the coordinates property , relative to their static position (its default position)-->
<!-- top : z px, it will be pushed down by z px; left: z px, will be pushed right-->
<!-- changing the position of relative elements will not affect the other elements position, it may appear above them -->
<!-- if i want to set aan element relative to a parent, its parent should have a relative position, else it will be relative to the body -->

<!-- ABSOLUTE/FIXED POSITIONING-->
<!-- absolute positioning is positioning the element relative to its parent -->
<!-- so if img {right:30px;} and it is inside a div, it will add a right margin of 30 px relative to the div element -->
<!-- absolute position affect the layout/position of other elements, the element will no longer be considered in the normal flow -->
<!-- fixed position will fix the position of the element even when scrolling, useful for sidebars, menubar -->


<!-- CENTERING ELEMENTS -->
<!-- text-align:center only works for elements without having their width set -->
<!-- if it is a block element with a width, u will use auto , as margin: 0 auto 0 auto;-->

<!-- SIZING -->
<!-- for the size of the text to be dynamic, use the unit em or %, 100% means 16px, 1em is 16px-->
<!-- when changing the font from settings chrome , the text font will change if it is set in % or em -->
<!-- the dynamic font size property is inherited, h1 will inherit the size from the body if it is set to z % or em -->
<!-- to avoid inheritance, use r(root)em -->

<!--FLOAT/CLEAR-->
<!-- clear: left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
     clear: right - The element is pushed below right floated elements -->
